  Autonomous improvement loop — repeatedly runs QA, Fix, and Refactor cycles to continuously improve code quality.
  Each round runs tests and auto-reverts refactoring commits that break tests.
  Leverages SuperClaude commands for enhanced analysis.
  Uses MCP servers (context7,playwright,tavily) for semantic analysis, documentation lookup, and multi-step reasoning.

# Autonomous Improvement Loop

Repeats QA → Fix → Refactor → Safety Check → Reflection → Self-Learning for up to {{rounds}} rounds.
Terminates early when open issues reach 0, or when abort conditions are triggered.

## Toolchain

This skill uses the following tools:

**SuperClaude commands:**
- `/sc:analyze` — Phase 1: Code and architecture structural analysis
- `/sc:troubleshoot` — Phase 2: Debug and root-cause test failures
- `/sc:cleanup` — Phase 3: Structured refactoring
- `/sc:reflect` — Phase 5: Structured retrospective

**MCP servers:**
- `context7` — Phase 2: Official documentation lookup for Hono and related tools
- `playwright` — Phase 1/4: Browser-based E2E test execution
- `tavily` — Phase 6: Web research for best practices

**Fallback rule:** If any MCP server or `/sc:` command is unavailable, log a warning and continue without it. MCPs and SuperClaude enhance the loop but are NOT required.

## Critical Safety Rules

- **All work MUST be done on a feature branch. NEVER modify the main branch.**
- Auto-revert refactoring commits when tests break after refactoring.
- Record results of each phase in `.improvement-state/`.
- Follow Conventional Commits commit format.
- **NEVER weaken or delete tests to make them pass.** Fix the implementation instead.

## Logging

After completing each phase and at each round boundary, record results in `.improvement-state/execution.log` and `.improvement-state/run.log`.

**execution.log format:**
```
[HH:MM:SS] [Phase N-name] result summary
```

**run.log format (per round):**
```
## Round N — YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
Result: found=X, fixed=Y
```

This logging is a **required workflow step** — the same as writing `issues-round-N.md` or `reflection-log.md`. Follow the **"Log:"** instruction at the end of each phase.

## Abort Conditions (Loop Stops Entirely)

The loop MUST stop immediately and report to the user if ANY of these occur:

1. **Git conflict**: Any git operation (revert, merge) fails with a conflict.
2. **Net regression**: Issue count INCREASES for 2 consecutive rounds.
3. **Recurring failure**: The same file/test fails in 2 consecutive rounds after being "fixed".
4. **Phase 2 regression**: A fix in Phase 2 causes NEW test failures that did not exist before.
5. **Consecutive reverts**: Phase 4 auto-revert triggers in 2 consecutive rounds.
6. **Test runner crash**: Test command exits non-zero but produces no failure lines AND no test summary (infrastructure failure, not test failure).
7. **Disk space critical**: Less than 500MB free disk space.

When aborting, output:
```
=== LOOP ABORTED ===
Reason: {specific abort condition}
Round: N / {{rounds}}
Branch: {branch name}
Last stable state: {git tag name}
Action required: {what the user should do}
```

## Phase 0: Setup (first round only)

1. Verify the working directory is a git repository.
2. Run `git status` to confirm the working tree is clean.
   - If not clean, warn the user and abort.
3. Check `timeout` command availability and save to persistent env file:
   ```bash
   if command -v timeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     TIMEOUT_CMD="timeout --kill-after=10s"
   elif command -v gtimeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     TIMEOUT_CMD="gtimeout --kill-after=10s"
   else
     TIMEOUT_CMD=""
     echo "⚠️ timeout command not available — tests will run without timeout protection"
   fi
   # Persist for use in all subsequent bash blocks
   mkdir -p .improvement-state
   echo "TIMEOUT_CMD=\"$TIMEOUT_CMD\"" > .improvement-state/timeout-env.sh
   ```
   `$TIMEOUT_CMD` is persisted in `.improvement-state/timeout-env.sh` for use in subsequent bash blocks.
4. Confirm the current branch is main.
5. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   BRANCH="improve/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   if git rev-parse --verify "$BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     echo "ERROR: Branch $BRANCH already exists. Aborting."
     exit 1
   fi
   git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
   ```
6. Create the state directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .improvement-state
   ```
7. Initialize execution log:
   ```bash
   echo "=== Improvement Loop Started ===" > .improvement-state/execution.log
   echo "Time: $(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')" >> .improvement-state/execution.log
   echo "Parameters: rounds={{rounds}}, focus={{focus}}, dry-run={{dry-run}}" >> .improvement-state/execution.log
   echo "" >> .improvement-state/execution.log
   ```
8. Initialize the run log:
   ```bash
   echo "# Run Log — $BRANCH" > .improvement-state/run.log
   echo "Started: $(date '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')" >> .improvement-state/run.log
   echo "Parameters: rounds={{rounds}}, focus={{focus}}, dry-run={{dry-run}}" >> .improvement-state/run.log
   ```
9. Load `.improvement-config.json` if it exists. Otherwise use default values.
10. **Capture test baseline** — run unit tests to record the initial state:
   ```bash
   cd api
   cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.improvement-state/test-baseline.log"
   BASELINE_UNIT_EXIT=$?
   cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```
   Also capture E2E baseline:
   ```bash
   make test-e2e 2>&1 2>&1 | tee .improvement-state/e2e-baseline.log
   BASELINE_E2E_EXIT=$?
   ```
   Extract baseline test counts from output. Record: `BASELINE_UNIT_TEST_COUNT`, `BASELINE_UNIT_FAIL_COUNT`.
   These baselines are used throughout the loop to detect regressions.
11. **Use available MCP servers to understand project structure** — Query semantic analysis tools for module structure, dependency graph, and key entry points.

**Initialize the round counter:**
Set `ROUND_NUM=1`. This variable tracks the current round number throughout the loop.

**Phase 0 complete. Proceed IMMEDIATELY to the Main Loop (starting at Phase 1 with ROUND_NUM=1).**

## Running Tests (Reference)

Whenever this skill says "run tests", follow this procedure:

1. **Run with timeout** (if available — detected in Phase 0):
   ```bash
   [ -f .improvement-state/timeout-env.sh ] && source .improvement-state/timeout-env.sh
   ${TIMEOUT_CMD:-} ${TEST_TIMEOUT:-120}s cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.log
   TEST_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
   ```
   If timeout is not available, run directly:
   ```bash
   cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.log
   TEST_EXIT=$?
   ```
2. **Classify exit code**: 124=timeout (HIGH issue), infrastructure failure patterns (Docker, port, disk) → NOT a test failure, else → actual test failure.
3. **Parse failures** using Vitest output patterns (see `references/qa-guide.md` for parsing rules).
4. **Create a separate issue for EACH failure** with: file, line, test name, error, severity=HIGH.
5. **Regression check**: If current test count < `BASELINE_UNIT_TEST_COUNT` → **ABORT** (test file deleted).

---

## Main Loop: Round 1 ~ {{rounds}}

**Repeat Phase 1 through Phase 5 for each round.** Use `ROUND_NUM` (initialized to 1 in Phase 0) as the current round number. After each round, the "Loop Continuation Decision" section at the end of Phase 5 determines whether to continue, exit, or proceed to finalization.

Log `[Round $ROUND_NUM/{{rounds}}]` at the start of each round.

### Phase 1: QA (Issue Detection)

Scope: {{focus}}

**Create a savepoint before this round:**
```bash
git tag "savepoint-round-$ROUND_NUM"
```

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/run.log`: `## Round $ROUND_NUM — {current timestamp}`
Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`: `[HH:MM:SS] [Round $ROUND_NUM] Started`

Run QA checks. If agent teams are available (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), run in parallel using separate agent teams. Otherwise, run sequentially.

#### 1-1. Lint (Biome)

```bash
cd api
cd api && npx biome check src/ 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/lint-output.log
LINT_EXIT=$?
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Extract warnings/errors from output and record as issues.

#### 1-2. Type Check (tsc)

```bash
cd api
cd api && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/typecheck-output.log
TYPECHECK_EXIT=$?
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Record type errors as issues (severity: HIGH — type errors mean compilation failure).

#### 1-3. Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
cd api
cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.log
UNIT_TEST_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Parse test output using Vitest patterns (see `references/qa-guide.md`).
File each failure as a separate issue.

#### 1-4. E2E Tests (Playwright)

Run the E2E test suite:
```bash
make test-e2e 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/e2e-output.log
E2E_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
```

Apply the same "Running Tests" procedure to E2E output.
If E2E infrastructure fails (Docker not running, port conflicts), log as "E2E infrastructure failure" and continue. Do NOT file test issues for infrastructure failures.

**E2E regression check**: If `BASELINE_E2E_EXIT` was 0 but `E2E_EXIT` is now non-zero, mark these as regressions.

#### 1-5. Code Analysis with /sc:analyze

Use `/sc:analyze` for structural analysis:

```
/sc:analyze "Analyze {{focus}} codebase for code quality issues:
- Type safety problems
- Error handling gaps
- Files exceeding 300 lines
- Functions exceeding 50 lines
- Missing input validation
- Hardcoded strings/config values
- Circular dependencies"
```

**MCP-enhanced analysis**: Use available MCP servers for deeper code understanding:
Use context7 to look up official documentation for Hono APIs before flagging potential misuse.

#### Code Review (Claude)

If no SuperClaude `/sc:analyze` is available, perform manual code review:
- Read source files in api,frontend
- Check for: type safety, error handling, file/function size limits, input validation, hardcoded values, circular dependencies
- Classify findings by severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

#### Issue Aggregation

Save all QA results to `.improvement-state/issues-round-N.md`:

```markdown
# Issues - Round N

**Found**: X issues | **Severity**: CRITICAL=0, HIGH=0, MEDIUM=0, LOW=0
**Baseline test count**: {BASELINE_TEST_COUNT} | **Current test count**: {current}

## Issues

### [SEVERITY] Short description
- **File**: `path/to/file:line`
- **Source**: lint | typecheck | unit-test | e2e | review
- **Detail**: Description of the problem
- **Suggestion**: Proposed fix (if any)
```

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`:
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 1] Unit tests — {passed} passed, {failed} failed (exit={code})`
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 1] Lint — {N} warnings, {M} errors`
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 1] Typecheck — {result}`
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 1] E2E — {result}`
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 1] Issues found: {total} (CRITICAL={n}, HIGH={n}, MEDIUM={n}, LOW={n})`

**Decision**:
- Issue count is 0 → exit the loop and proceed to Phase 7 (Finalize).
- **Quality gate check**: If `.improvement-config.json` defines `quality_gates`, enforce them:
  - `max_critical_issues`: If CRITICAL count exceeds this, **ABORT** with "Quality gate failed: too many CRITICAL issues".
  - `max_high_issues`: If HIGH count exceeds this, **ABORT** with "Quality gate failed: too many HIGH issues".
  - `min_test_pass_rate`: If test pass rate drops below this percentage, **ABORT** with "Quality gate failed: test pass rate below threshold".
  - A `null` value for any gate means it is not enforced.
- **Net regression check**: If this round's issue count > previous round's, increment `REGRESSION_COUNTER`. If `REGRESSION_COUNTER >= 2`, trigger abort condition #2.

### Phase 2: Fix (Issue Resolution)

Skip this phase if {{dry-run}} is true.

#### 2-1. Auto-fix with Tools

Apply lint auto-fixes first:
```bash
cd api
cd api && npx biome check --write src/ 2>&1 | tee /tmp/lint-fix-output.log
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

#### 2-2. Fix Test Failures (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Test failure issues MUST be fixed before all other issues.**

**Use `/sc:troubleshoot` for debugging:**
```
/sc:troubleshoot "Test failure in {test file name}:
Error: {error message}
Analyze the root cause and suggest a fix."
```

Fix procedure:
1. **Read the source code** of both the failing test file and the implementation under test.
2. **Identify the cause**.
3. **Decide the fix strategy**:
   - Bug in implementation → fix the implementation (NEVER weaken tests)
   - Mock/setup issue in test → fix the test code (legitimate fix)
   - Outdated test → update the test
4. **Verify the fix** by re-running only that test file:
   ```bash
   cd api
   cd api && npx vitest run {testfile} 2>&1 | tee /tmp/single-test-output.log
   SINGLE_TEST_EXIT=$?
   cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```
   If failures remain, retry (maximum 3 attempts per test). If still failing after 3 attempts, log as "unresolvable" and proceed.

#### 2-3. Fix Review Findings

Prioritize HIGH severity and above. Only fix MEDIUM and below if safe and low-risk.

#### 2-4. Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: resolve N QA issues [round $ROUND_NUM]"
```

#### 2-5. Post-fix Regression Check (MANDATORY)

After committing Phase 2 fixes, run the full test suite:

```bash
cd api
cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/postfix-output.log
POSTFIX_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

- **All tests pass**: Proceed to Phase 3.
- **New failures appear** (not in Phase 1 issue list): **Trigger abort condition #4.** Revert:
  ```bash
  git revert --no-edit HEAD
  ```
  Skip to Phase 5.
- **Same failures as Phase 1 remain**: Proceed to Phase 3.

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`:
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 2] Fixed {Y}/{X} issues, committed {hash}` — or if reverted: `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 2] REGRESSION — fix reverted`

### Phase 3: Refactor (Quality Improvement)

Skip this phase if {{dry-run}} is true.

**Pre-condition gate (MANDATORY):**
Run the full test suite:
```bash
cd api
cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/phase3-precheck-output.log
PHASE3_PRECHECK_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

**If ANY test fails:**
1. Attempt fix (maximum 2 attempts).
2. If fixed: commit as `fix: repair failing tests before refactor [round $ROUND_NUM]`
3. Re-run to confirm ALL tests pass.
4. If still failing: **skip Phase 3**, proceed to Phase 5. Log: "Refactoring skipped — tests not stable."

**Check refactor blocklist:** Load `.improvement-state/refactor-blocklist.json`. Skip any file/strategy combination that previously caused a revert.

**Use `/sc:cleanup` for refactoring:**
```
/sc:cleanup "{target file path} — strategy: {refactoring strategy}"
```

Also refer to `references/refactor-patterns.md` for safe refactoring patterns.

Maximum refactorings per round (configurable via `refactor.max_per_round` in `.improvement-config.json`, default: 3).

Refactoring candidate selection criteria:
- Files where Phase 1 found issues
- Files exceeding 300 lines
- Functions exceeding 50 lines
- Complex conditionals (nesting 3+ levels)
- Duplicate code
- **Exclude files in refactor-blocklist**

**Commit each refactoring individually:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: {specific description} [round $ROUND_NUM]"
```

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`:
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 3] Refactored {N} files, committed {hash}` — or `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 3] Skipped (tests unstable)`

### Phase 4: Safety Check

Only run if refactoring was performed in Phase 3.

Both unit tests and E2E tests MUST pass for the round to be considered safe.

```bash
cd api
cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/safety-unit-output.log
SAFETY_UNIT_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

```bash
make test-e2e 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/safety-e2e-output.log
SAFETY_E2E_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
```

Run the test count regression check (current total >= BASELINE_UNIT_TEST_COUNT).

#### On all tests passing

Proceed to Phase 5. Reset `CONSECUTIVE_REVERT_COUNT` to 0.

#### On test failure — Auto-Revert

Identify and revert Phase 3 refactoring commits using stable SHAs:

```bash
# Collect refactor commit SHAs (newest first)
REFACTOR_SHAS=$(git log --oneline "savepoint-round-$ROUND_NUM"..HEAD | grep "refactor:.*\[round $ROUND_NUM\]" | awk '{print $1}')

# Revert each (newest first)
for SHA in $REFACTOR_SHAS; do
  if ! git revert --no-edit "$SHA" 2>&1; then
    git revert --abort
    # Trigger abort condition #1 (git conflict)
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

After revert, re-run tests:
```bash
cd api
cd api && npm test 2>&1 2>&1 | tee /tmp/post-revert-output.log
POST_REVERT_EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

- **Tests pass**: Add file + strategy to `.improvement-state/refactor-blocklist.json`. Increment `CONSECUTIVE_REVERT_COUNT`.
- **Tests still fail**: Revert to the savepoint:
  ```bash
  git revert --no-edit "savepoint-round-$ROUND_NUM"..HEAD
  ```

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`:
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 4] Safety check — PASSED` — or `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 4] Safety check — REVERTED ({N} commits)`

**Consecutive revert check**: If `CONSECUTIVE_REVERT_COUNT >= 2`, trigger abort condition #5.

### Phase 5: Reflection (Record Results)

**Use `/sc:reflect` for a structured retrospective:**
```
/sc:reflect "Improvement Loop Round $ROUND_NUM retrospective:
- QA found X issues
- Fixed Y issues
- Refactored Z files (reverted: W)
- Safety Check: PASSED/REVERTED/SKIPPED
Analyze what went well, what didn't, and patterns to watch."
```

Append to `.improvement-state/reflection-log.md`:

```markdown
## Round N - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

| Phase | Result |
|-------|--------|
| QA | X issues found |
| Fix | Y/X issues fixed |
| Post-fix regression | PASSED / REVERTED |
| Refactor | Z refactorings applied / SKIPPED |
| Safety Check | PASSED / REVERTED / SKIPPED |

### Modified Files
- `path/to/file1` - summary of changes

### Observations
(1-3 sentence summary)

---
```

**Log:** Append to `.improvement-state/execution.log`:
- `[HH:MM:SS] [Phase 5] Reflection — issues={X}, fixed={Y}, rate={Z}%`

Append to `.improvement-state/run.log`:
- `Result: found={X}, fixed={Y}`

### Loop Continuation Decision

**This is the critical loop control point.** After completing Phase 5, decide the next action:

1. **If issues found == 0 in this round**: Exit the loop. Proceed to Phase 7 (Finalize). Log: "No issues found — exiting loop early at round $ROUND_NUM."
2. **If $ROUND_NUM == {{rounds}}** (maximum rounds reached): Proceed to Phase 6 (Self-Learning), then Phase 7 (Finalize). Log: "Maximum rounds reached."
3. **Otherwise** (issues remain AND rounds remaining):
   - Set `ROUND_NUM = ROUND_NUM + 1`
   - **GO BACK TO "Phase 1: QA (Issue Detection)" above** and execute the entire Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 sequence again.
   - Do NOT proceed to Phase 6 or Phase 7.
   - Log: "Round $ROUND_NUM complete. Issues remain. Proceeding to round $((ROUND_NUM+1))."

**⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST repeat Phase 1 through Phase 5 for each round. This is a LOOP, not a single pass. Do NOT stop after one round unless exit condition 1 or 2 is met.**

---

### Phase 6: Self-Learning (Improve the Improvement Process)

**Run ONLY after the final round** (when exiting the loop due to condition 1 or 2 above).

Analyze all rounds in `.improvement-state/reflection-log.md`:
- Organize trends in issue count, fix count, and revert rate across rounds
- Identify recurring issue category patterns
- Generate prioritized improvement suggestions

**Use available MCP tools** for deeper analysis and best practice research.

Save output to `.improvement-state/self-learning-suggestions.md`:

```markdown
# Self-Learning Suggestions

Generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
Rounds analyzed: 1-N

## Suggestions

### [IMPACT: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] Suggestion title
- **Current**: Current setting/behavior
- **Proposed**: Proposed change
- **Rationale**: Evidence-based reasoning
- **Action**: Which parameter in `.improvement-config.json` to change
```

**These suggestions are NOT auto-applied.** The user reviews and manually updates the config.

## Phase 7: Finalize

After all rounds complete (or early termination):

**Clean up Docker containers:**
```bash
docker ps --filter "label=org.testcontainers=true" --format "{{{{.ID}}}}" | xargs -r docker stop 2>/dev/null
docker ps -a --filter "label=org.testcontainers=true" --format "{{{{.ID}}}}" | xargs -r docker rm 2>/dev/null
```

1. Output a final summary:
   ```
   === Improvement Loop Summary ===
   Rounds completed: X / {{rounds}}
   Total issues found: Y
   Total issues fixed: Z
   Refactorings applied: W (reverted: V)
   Branch: $BRANCH

   === Changes Summary ===
   {output of: git log main..$BRANCH --oneline}
   {output of: git diff main...$BRANCH --stat}
   ```

2. **[MANUAL GATE]** Ask the user whether to push the branch:
   ```
   Push $BRANCH to origin? The summary above shows all changes.
   ```
   - If confirmed: `git push -u origin "$BRANCH"`. Check exit code.
   - If not confirmed: Keep branch local.

3. Suggest creating a PR (do not auto-create).

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Docker not running | Skip tests that require Docker, continue QA with lint only |
| E2E infrastructure failure | Log warning, continue without E2E. Do NOT file test issues |
| Lint tool not found | Skip lint |
| Git conflict | **ABORT** the loop (abort condition #1) |
| Test timeout (exit code 124) | Treat as HIGH-severity issue. If 3+ timeouts in one run, ABORT |
| 0 issues in all rounds | Report "codebase is in good shape" |
| MCP server not connected | Log warning, continue without that MCP |
| /sc: command not installed | Log warning, continue without SuperClaude |
| Disk space < 500MB | **ABORT** (abort condition #7) |
| Test count decreased | **ABORT** — potential test file deletion |
